{"name":"Foxnewsnetwork.github.io","tagline":"github page","body":"### Thomas Chen's Running Portfolio of Various Works\r\nSome sort of Ruby, Javascript, and Matlab /(soft|hard)/ware engineer by profession, I also dabble in creative writing, for-fun math, physics, chemistry, and haskell (and more recently erlang through elixir). Here's a rough collection and summary of projects I've worked on, gems I've published, etc.\r\n\r\n#### Cascadence (Ruby)\r\nFunctional integration testing is suffering. It's hard to pass, hard to maintain, hard to run, and hard to sit through. Cascadence solve any of those problems, but it does make writing, running, and maintaining the tests easier by structuring tests to follow a merge / fork flow based perspective. This allows for easy multithreading and concurrency for running integration tests.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ gem install cascadence\r\nOR\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:foxnewsnetwork/cascadence.git\r\n$ cd cascadence && rake install\r\n```\r\n### Openstory (RPGMaker IV & Ruby)\r\nVideo games these days are all about flashy graphics or neat gameplay; gamers and game-makers alike nowadays gaffle and gasp over how innovative and cool some new game feature or how spiffy the character costume design looks. Graphics and toys are nice, but gone are the good old days when us story tellers should to weave color onto the blank canvas of the gamer's imagination with nothing more than words. Gone are the days when characters drew us in with nothing more than their thoughts, actions, and personalities.\r\n\r\nGone, these things might be from the mainstream industry, but it's certainly not gone from this budding project. Note, not to be a pleb-tier hater, but you'll need a windows machine if you want to run this.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:foxnewsnetwork/openstory.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Bang Online! (Angularjs)\r\nBang! is a popular card game that is played mostly by college students looking for ways to make innuendos about sex and alcohol. Like many things that is fun in real life but not so much on the internet, I making a project for it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:foxnewsnetwork/bang-online.git\r\n$ cd bang-online\r\n$ grunt server\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Autofold (Ruby)\r\nrails scaffold is great, but sometimes, what if I want to scaffold more than just 1 resource at a time? What if I wanted to scaffold simply related resources like users that have many accounts and items which have many offers? Autofold interprets a simply expression and builds your web assets for you so you can spend your time being unemployed.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ gem install autofold\r\nOR\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:foxnewsnetwork/autofold.git\r\n$ cd autofold && rake install\r\n\r\n$ autofold generate 'users:(accounts+items:offers)'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Ruby Units (obviously Ruby)\r\nAn implementation of units for the purposes of pseudo-science in Ruby (one really shouldn't use ruby for real scientific calculation)\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:foxnewsnetwork/simple_units.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Ruby Lazy List (obviously Ruby)\r\nA SICP-friendly lambda based implementation of lazy list. It works, but because of lack of TCO in ruby, please don't use this for thing other than solving fizzbuzz or other joke problems\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:foxnewsnetwork/lazy_list.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tsundere (ruby)\r\nYes, it's another permission gem for Ruby... worse yet, this one is influenced by category theory and haskell. Strictly speaking, tsundere is an implementation of haskell's Arrow typeclass and, when attached to an object, implements haskell's monad typeclass. It provides a clean and elegant but pointlessly complicated and mathy way of dealing with permission.\r\n\r\nIn common terms, it exposes only portions of objects that certain users with correct permissions may access.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ gem install tsundere\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Pigs (Javascript)\r\nA (poorly done) angry birds clone with pigs being thrown instead of birds. Why? Don't ask.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:foxnewsnetwork/Husbandry125.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Other stuff\r\nPlenty of web apps and whatnot live in my repo counts... not going to go through all of them here today because my BART train has almost reached the last stop where I live.\r\n\r\nThe rest is just github pages credits\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
